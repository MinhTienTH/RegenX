## Overview

This system provides farmers with a simple, accessible way to measure their compost piles using only a smartphone camera. The solution combines computer vision and machine learning techniques to:
- Identify compost piles in photos
- Calculate pile volume in cubic meters
- Track measurements over time

## Photo Requirements

For accurate measurements, farmers should:
1. Take 3-4 photos of the pile from different angles (90¬∞ apart)
2. Place a 1-meter measuring stick next to the pile
3. Ensure good lighting (daylight preferred)
4. Capture the entire pile in each frame
5. Maintain 3-5 meters distance from pile

## Technical Solution

### 1. Compost Pile Identification
```python
def identify_compost_pile(image):
    # Load pre-trained model
    model = load_model('compost_classifier.h5')
    
    # Preprocess image
    processed_image = preprocess_image(image)
    
    # Get prediction
    prediction = model.predict(processed_image)
    
    return prediction > CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD
```

### 2. Volume Estimation Process

#### A. Camera Calibration
```python
def calibrate_scale(image):
    # Detect reference object (measuring stick)
    reference_object = detect_reference_object(image)
    
    # Calculate pixels-to-meters ratio
    pixels_per_meter = calculate_scale(reference_object)
    
    return pixels_per_meter
```

#### B. Pile Segmentation
```python
def segment_pile(image):
    # Apply semantic segmentation to isolate pile
    mask = semantic_segmentation(image)
    
    # Refine edges using active contours
    refined_mask = active_contour(mask)
    
    return refined_mask
```

#### C. 3D Reconstruction
```python
def reconstruct_3d(images, masks):
    # Extract features from multiple views
    features = extract_features(images)
    
    # Match features across images
    matches = match_features(features)
    
    # Perform Structure from Motion (SfM)
    point_cloud = structure_from_motion(matches)
    
    # Generate mesh from point cloud
    mesh = generate_mesh(point_cloud)
    
    return mesh
```
